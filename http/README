Usage Instructions for Simple HTTP CLient and Server
----------------------------------------------------

The HTTP server here supports two endpoints:
1. time - Gives the current time
2. news - Gives a RSS feed of the latest news

The server can be installed and run using the following commands:
--snip--
# To install server
$ go install server.go

# To run server
$ go run server.go
--snip--
This command starts the server and has it running on port 8080.

Once the server is up and running, the client can be similarly installed
and run:
--snip--
$ go install client.go
$ go run client.go
--snip--

This prompts the user for a URL. The URL could be either of the following (if
the client is run on the same machine as the server):
1. http://localhost:8080/time - To fetch the current time
2. http://localhost:8080/news - To fetch a RSS feed of the latest news

If the client is not running on the same machine as the server, "localhost"
would have to be replaced with the server's host name/IP address.

Note that the client is not limited to just the attached server's endpoints. It
may access any URL in the internet.
